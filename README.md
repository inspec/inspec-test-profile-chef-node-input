# Test InSpec Profile - Chef Node Passthru

This is an Chef InSpec Profile used in testing the Audit Cookbook. It is used in the audit cookbook's Kitchen file to detect the presence of an Input, `chef_node`. The Audit Cookbook optionally passes this Input thru based on a Chef Infra attribute.

This repo is part of the test infrastructure of the Audit Cookbook and is not intended to be consumed by the general public.
